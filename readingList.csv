https://fusectore.dev/2022/09/25/github-actions-pitfalls.html,How well do you know GitHub Actions? | fusectore.dev,"During one of my assignments, I worked with GitHub Actions pretty much every day. I implemented workflows, created new actions, and helped people migrate their projects from jenkins to actions. As much as I like actions – and I like them a lot – there are some things that caught me off guard. I have collected some of these things, both for other people to let them know, and for myself as a future reference. How well do you know actions? Can you answer all of these questions correctly? ℹ️ Assume that all YAML and code is valid/compiles Output from a previous job What does the following print? jobs: jobOne: runs-on: ubuntu-latest outputs: foo: ${{ steps.foo.outputs.foo }} steps: - run: echo '::set-output name=foo::bar' id: foo jobTwo: needs: jobOne runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - run: echo hello jobThree: needs: jobTwo runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - run: echo ${{ needs.jobOne.outputs.foo }} Solution: It prints an empty line, because if you want to access an output from a job, you need to list it as a dependency. Outputs from transitive dependencies cannot be accessed. To fix this, make the third job depend on the first job explicitly needs: [jobOne, jobTwo] Exec explodes GitHub provides action developers with a toolkit to develop actions in JavaScript. One of the functions in there is called exec and can be used to run a command. Here’s its signature: /** * Exec a command. * Output will be streamed to the live console. * Returns promise with return code * * @param commandLine command to execute (can include additional args). Must be correctly escaped. * @param args optional arguments for tool. Escaping is handled by the lib. * @param options optional exec options. See ExecOptions * @returns Promise<number> exit code */ export async function exec( commandLine: string, args?: string[], options?: ExecOptions ): Promise<number> In an action, you might use it like so: const returnCode = await exec.exec('node', ['index.js']); if (returnCode != 0) { console.error('Uh! Something did not quite work :(') } Do you see any problems with that code? The problem is that exec does not return a non-zero return code if the command fails. Instead, it returns a rejected promise. So if you want to handle the error case, you need to wrap it in a try-catch block. While this behavior can be changed by passing ignoreReturnCode as the third argument ExecOptions, the default behavior is very surprising. I have seen many examples of people checking the return code without knowing how this function really behaves. Nevertheless, I still think throwing an error by default is probably not a bad choice, given that (A) many people ignore error handling and (B) you probably want to abort on error. Push for all? Say you’re working on your open source project, and you just started using actions to make sure the build always passes: on: push jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # etc.. The push trigger seems to do the trick in all cases: You can push to a branch (or pull request) and the build runs. You can push to the main branch and the build runs. But there’s a scenario where it won’t run. Do you know when? Solution: If I fork your project and create a pull request, then push won’t trigger. If you want the PRs of external contributors to be validated with your workflows as well, you need to use the trigger pull_request. And once you do that, you also need to make sure the push only triggers on main, because otherwise your own pull requests will trigger the workflow twice (both from push and pull_request): on: pull_request: push: branches: [main] When talking about running actions from contributors, it is important to mention that: You can control how actions are triggered in pull requests from forks by Approving workflow runs from public forks Secrets are generally not available in PRs from forks, except for $GITHUB_TOKEN, which is read-only. There’s a trigger called pull_request_target to work around that, but you need to be careful as this open up the gates for potential vulnerabilities. Too much information, GitHub Say I have an open pull request based on a branch called my-feature, and the following workflow is triggered. What does it print? on: pull_request jobs: branch: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - run: echo ${{ github.ref_name }} I’ll even give you the docs on github.ref_name: The short ref name of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow run. This value matches the branch or tag name shown on GitHub. For example, feature-branch-1. I’m going to guess you said my-feature, but unfortunately you’re wrong. It is going to print the PR number followed by /merge. For example, it would print 18/merge for the 18th pull request in your repository. Why is that? 🤔 The simple explanation is that when you create a pull request on GitHub, they create some additional internal(!) branches to make it easier for them to manage your pull request and tell you how it compares to the branch you want to merge into. As a result of that, when you run a workflow on a pull_request event, it runs on one of these “internal” branches rather than the one you just pushed. In terms of contents on your branch, this doesn’t make a difference – you’re still running your builds and tests on your contents – it’s just the branch name that is different. Unfortunately, this implementation detail is exposed here. Please see this answer on stackoverflow for more information. Note that $GITHUB_SHA is not what you’d expect either So how can you access the name of your branch in a pull request? It’s in the payload from the event: on: pull_request jobs: branch: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - run: echo ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }} Bonus: Am I there or not? Consider this reusable workflow: on: workflow_call: inputs: my-input: description: optional input required: false type: string jobs: greet: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: my/action@v1 with: my-input: ${{ inputs.my-input }} Let’s say the action my/action@v1 has an optional input my-input which has a default value my-value. Now if you were to call the reusable workflow as shown in the following example, what value would be passed to my/action@v1? Would the default be used? jobs: jobA: uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@v1 Solution: An empty string is passed to my/action@v1 as my-input. The way this works is that if no value is passed to the reusable workflow, then the input my-input is still passed to the action, but it’s passed as an empty string. And even though we usually see an empty string as “no value passed”, the default value is not used here, because we did pass something. If you wanted to use the default value if no input was passed, then you’d have to invoke the action differently based on whether the input was passed to the reusable workflow. steps: - uses: my/action@v1 if: inputs.my-input with: my-input: ${{ inputs.my-input }} - uses: my/action@v1 if: inputs.my-input == '' This has been a long-standing issue in the runner, but there’s likely no easy solution that does not break existing workflows.",,2022-09-26T11:20:57.821639349Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32970198,,,fusectore.dev

https://rybakov.com/project/im_sitting_in_ai/,I'm sitting in AI · Michail Rybakov,"     Alvin Lucier’s 1981 work ‘I Am Sitting In A Room’ is a classic of media art. Lucier recorded himself reading a text, then played it back and recorded it again. Then played back the recording of the recording and recorded it again. After a while his words were hardly decipherable, as the resonance of the room, multiplied again and again, took over. AI-based super resolution algorithms try to upscale an image in a way that seems most natural. That includes generating details that were not present in the original image. There are quite a few super resolution algorithms available, from open source ERSGAN, SwinIR and BSRGAN to those included in commercial products such as Topaz Labs’ Gigapixel AI, Photoshop and Pixelmator. They are trained on different data and work in slightly different ways. But they all do need to ‘dream’, to infer some image details where there were none before. But what are those details? Are they different for each model? In order to see that I let each AI model reinforce its idiosynchrasies, again and again, until its resonance became visible just as the resonance of the room was reinforced in Alvin Lucier’s work. I let each super resolution algorithms upscale an image, again and again, slightly (4-15%) zooming im between the steps. After a while, AI begins to upscale its own artifacts, with some algorithms trapping themselves in a solid color, while others continuing to generate imaginary details indefinitely. I selected a photograph with a lot of details as a starting point.          	This will be our starting image.     Zooming in by a typical non-AI algorithm would look something like this:                         Now let’s see what kind of artifacts are generated by the AI-based upscaling algorithms.                         Pixelmator, 15% zoom per frame. Pixelmator upscales an image x3 instead of the more common x2 or x4. It is also special as it continues to generate this kind of dust detail in the video and could go on indefinitely.                         Photoshop, 8% zoom per frame. Photoshop generates these cristalline looking high-contrast structures, until it gets stuck in a solid color.                         Photoshop, 11,5% zoom per frame. With some settings or starting images Photoshop gets stuck in a texture and continues to generate it until it converges to black or white.                         Gigapixel AI, 13% zoom per frame, standard setting. Here we can observe how at some point it seems to generate the texture of water as seen from above from a solid blue color. It doesn’t happen with other solid colors.                         Gigapixel AI, 14% per frame. Gigapixel AI is special as it offers multiple models trained on different kind of images. This one was trained specifically for upscaling low quality images.                         Gigapixel AI, 5% per frame. This one was upscaled using a model trained on CG art images.                         SwinIR exceedingly increases the contrast of the image, and ends up (in this case of 4% upscale per step) with a sequence repeating indefinitely.                         ESRGAN is pretty violent in what it does to images, darkening the image in the first few steps, then removing the details while emphasizing the edges. 6% zoom per frame. But it also contains an option to include GFPGAN to upscale faces better. Here I’ll try using it on Ilya Repin’s masterpiece.          	Cossacks write a letter to the Turkish sultan, Ilya Repin, 1891.                             ESRGAN with 4% zoom per frame. The option to include GFPGAN to upscale faces is enabled. In reality that turns out to be quite a destructive option, generating similar but different faces in place.                         Here is the same image with the same 4% setting using ESRGAN, but without GFPGAN.                         Similar to ESRGAN, BSRGAN overemphasizes the edges, but does not darken the image, filling it with colorful gradients instead. Technical details and code The image is upscaled to whatever the particular model is trained for (2x, 3x or 4x). Then the image is downscaled to around 104%-115% (whatever produces the more visible effect) of the original image, and cropped at 100% of the original image, thus generating the starting image for the next cycle. code tbd.",https://rybakov.com/cover-angrymark4.jpg,2022-11-12T00:03:34.558146562Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32700065,1668211399.png,1668211402.pdf,rybakov.com

Perhaps you want to rotate some TLS certificates before they expire, or delete old files that are no longer needed. Typically for this, you would use cron, perhaps the most widely used job scheduler for UNIX like systems. You would fire up the crontab for the user, punch in the schedule followed by the command, then write and quit. If you wanted to monitor the job, then you would add MAILTO at the top to receive the cron logs should the job fail.

https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/when-did-new-york-start-building,When did New York start building slowly? - by Brian Potter,"It’s good to be able to build things quickly. The faster you build something, the quicker the benefits from it accrue, making it more valuable. Additionally, you can reallocate your resources to another project, letting you build more things overall. Building things faster also generally means building them cheaper. If you’re building slowly, you’re probably building inefficiently, spending more time and effort than is really required. It’s also hard to avoid accumulating costs as a project drags on: you end up with more financing costs, more project status meetings, more time spent getting people up to speed as the team working on the project changes. And the longer a project takes, the more chances there are for something to go horribly wrong.

https://blog.owulveryck.info/2023/12/02/simplifying-complexity-the-journey-from-websockets-to-http-streams.html,Simplifying Complexity: The Journey from WebSockets to HTTP Streams - Unladen swallow - Olivier Wulveryck,"This article explores the transition from a WebSocket-based implementation to a simpler, more direct stream over HTTP in the context of capturing touch screen inputs on Linux. It begins by introducing the main theme, encapsulated in the statement Everything is a file is a stream of byte. The need to capture finger positions on a touchscreen by reading /dev/input/events in Linux is initially discussed, followed by a dilemma of transferring this data to a JavaScript client in a browser. Initially, WebSockets are chosen, leading to a discussion on how frameworks often shape our technological choices and the challenges faced in debugging WebSocket connections. The article then introduces an alternative about sending a stream of bytes over HTTP, drawing a parallel to Linux’s approach to handling devices and files. Serialization, the process of encoding messages for this stream, is discussed next, highlighting the implementation specifics in GoLang and its native advantages. The final section covers how to receive and decode this stream in JavaScript within a worker thread, and then send the decoded messages to the main thread using post requests. The article concludes by reflecting on the benefits of simplicity in technology, urging readers to reevaluate default choices and consider more straightforward solutions to complex problems.

In the enterprise space in particular, it often involves a multi-year commitment with long-lasting implications on the roadmap of the project, the pace of its development, the quality of the deliverables, and even the ability to assemble and maintain a happy team.The open-source software model is a fundamental answer to this. By using software that is developed in the open, anyone is free to extend it or modify it in whatever way fits their use case. More crucially, the portability of open-source software gives developers and organisations the freedom to move their infrastructure between different providers without fear of getting locked in to a specific vendor.This is the expectation with Next.js, an open-source web development framework created and [governed by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/governance), a cloud provider that offers managed hosting of Next.js as a service.",https://eduardoboucas.com/assets/images/logo-600x600.png,2025-03-27T06:22:29.777389633Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43481295,1743056534.png,1743056537.pdf,eduardoboucas.com
